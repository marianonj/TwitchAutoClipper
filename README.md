# TwitchAutoClipper
A program that suggests highlights based on chat message frequency, content, and audio cues. 

# How to use
1. Clone repository and install requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
2. Place the urls of the vods you wish to clip in urls.txt. 
3. Run main.py.

# ToDo
- Add audio matching that suggests clips based on audio signal correlation, allowing the program to generate clips based on game sounds.
- Adjust clip logic to better account for multiple text comparison buckets.
